MONTHLY BULLETIN, INDIANA STATE BOARD OF HEALTH

	Mr. O. and his son are now being vaccinated against
typhoid.
	The conclusions to be drawn from these cases are as
follows:
	1. No person who nurses a case of typhoid fever should
have anything to do with preparing or cooking food for
anybody else.
	2. The nurse should carefully sterilize her hands before
eating.
	3. The feces and urine must be sterilized before dis-
posal.
	4. All bed linen and other things used by typhoid pa-
tients must be sterilized before being washed or used by 
any one else.
	5. All members of the family, as well as the nurse,
should be vaccinated against typhoid.
	6. In all cases, where possible, the patient should be
isolated from the family, or, even better, taken to a general
hospital, if it is possible.
	The rules are very necessary, for after water, milk and
bacilli carriers, direct contact with persons sick with
typhoid fever is the most fruitful source of typhoid infec-
tion.
