NATURAL DEATH. 

The instinct for life is indeed strong. It is ascendant even in moments of intense pain or extreme discourage.ment when one might say,
"I wish I were dead." We look aghast at the suicide and finally explain the act on the assumption of insanity. Yet, death is natural and neces-
sary,and there are not lacking reasons for believing that it is always painless, perhaps pleasant, and the dying person never is cognizant of his condition
nor of the moment he dies. No more, indeed, than one is cognizant of the moment he passes into ordinary sleep. The writers have ever compared death
with sleep. Dickens, in describing the death of little Nell, says: "No sleep so beautiful and calm, so fair to look upon." Still, despite all this,
we fear death, Even the word causes us to shudder. Bryant tells us--

So live that when the final summons comes 
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night, 
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed 
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave 
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams. 

Here the writer believes that an "unfaltering trust" will enable one to die peacefully and contentedly. But how are we to come by this? Surely a diseased body will not contribute to its possession. The adoption of high, moral and religious
ideals would perforce attend only a healthy body. Sound minds are not found in unsound bodies. From every point of view, a normal body is required in
order to enjoy a normal life, and if death is to be natural, it will attend only a normal life. A pathological or diseased body can not end
naturally. True natural death, which must be very rare in the human race, has been described as follows: "Arrival at extreme age, and still preserving
the last flickers of an expiring Intelligence, the old man feels weakness gaining on him from day to day. His limbs refuse to obey his will, the skin
becomes insensitive, dry and cold; the extremities lose their warmth ; the face is thin; the eyes hollow and the sight weak; speech dies out on his
lips which remain open; life quits the old man from the circumference towards the center; breathing grows labored, and at last tbe heart stops
beating. The old man passes away quietly, seeming to fall asleep for the last time." Death from pneumonia, which is a common cause of death among old
people, is pathological. The pneumonia death has often beeit described as peaceful and painless, but there is always great suffering before the
unconsciousness precedent to dissolution.

Arthobiosis, or right living, is essential to natural life and natural death. That civilized man leads an
unnatural life is plain. He does not and will not conform to the laws of his well-being. The consequences are illness, disease and premature and
unnatural death. We love, or at least we tend toward complexity in life; and this complexity militates against health, happiness and natural death.
Delicate and rich foods and all stimulants act upon the organs of digestion and secretion in a harmful way. It would be a marked step toward greater
health, strength and longer life to stop inventing new dishes and totally abandon most of those already invented and return to the simple dishes of
our ancestors. Solomon says: "Be ye not among wine bibbers: among riotous eaters of flesh." He was preaching morality and <sic>orthobiosis</sic> when he said
this. One of the conditions that enabled the Jews of the earlier Biblical times to live longer than civilized people was, beyond all doubt, the
greater simplicity of thin diet. Modern hygiene, which is in open disagreement with the elaborated art of cooking, is also opposed to the complexities
of modern dress and dwellings. Young people, instead of abandoning them.selves to the supposed pleasures with thin sad morbid re.sults of sickness,
pain and premature death, should live the physiological life and enjoy healthful and happy life with a natural death.
