                            THE HOUSEFLY. 

    It is only of late years that people have come to look
upon the housefly as a disease-breeder, being more disposed
to look upon the busy diptuous insect as a scavenger, but
modern science has changed all this. 
    In his book, "The Housefly--Disease Carrier," Dr. L. O.
Howard, Government expert, says:
 
    Take, for example, the possibilities in Washington and
let us estimate–on the basis of the survival of all eggs
and all individual flies–upon plenty of places for the insect
to develop and for the larvae* to feed, upon an average of
ten days to a generation in midsummer (this period in-
creasing in the autumn and being greater also in the spring-
time)–let us start then on April 15 with a single overwin-
tering fly, which on that day lays 120 eggs and we will
have the following table: 

    April 15–The overwintering female fly lays 120 eggs. 
    May 1–120 adults issue, of which 6O are females. 
    May 10–60 females lay 120 eggs each. 
    May 28–7,200 adults issue, of which 3,600 are females. 
    June 8–3,600 females lay 120 eggs each.
    June 20–132,000 adults issue, of which 216,000 are fe-
males. 
    June 30–216,000 females lay 120 eggs each. 
    July 10–25,920,000 adults issue, of which 12,960,000 are 
females. 
    July 19–12,960,000 females lay 120 eggs each. 
    July 29–1,555,200,000 adults issue, of which 777,600,000 
are females. 
    August 8–777,600,000 females lay 120 eggs each. 
    August 18–93,312,000,000 adults issue, of which 46,656,-
000,000 are females.
    August 28–16,656,000,000 females lay 120 eggs each. 
    September 10–5,598,72O,000,000 adults issue. 
    These figures are startling, and surely the housefly,
whether a disease-carrier or not, has enough sins to answer 
for to condemn him and cause people to swat him relent-
lessly.

          CANCER IN FISHES.

    Attention has recently been called to the long known
fact that fishes are especially subject to cancer and other
infectious diseases, by the announcement that the United
States Government is about to establish a biological station
having for its special purpose the study of these maladies.
Cancer seems to be almost epidemic at certain times among
fishes, destroying great numbers. Dr. Williams, of Eng-
land, has observed that cancerous tumors occur in trees
which grow in low regions in which the soil is saturated
with sewage. It seems quite reasonable that cancer in fish
may be due to a somewhat similar cause. An evident objec-
tion to the use of fish as food is the fact that one can never
know how near he is coming to a cancer diet in eating a
morsel of fish.

      GOOD COUNTY HEALTH WORK AND BIG
              INVESTMENTS.
    Wise business men who have seen enough of health
work to appreciate its importance, and who know the dif-
ference between a death rate of twelve and twenty-five per
1,000, will not tie up large sums of money in a community
or country where sanitary conditions are questionable. Men
who mean much to the development of a community or town
are now consulting not only our national and State depart-





ments of agriculture, but also hoards of health as to places
for investments. The following letter is to the point. This
man, if he follows Dr. Stiles' advice and comes South, must
locate in North Carolina, and in either Guilford, Durham,
New Hanover, or Robeson County. The letter is as follows:

                                      FEBRUARY 6, 1912. 
Dr. W. S. Rankin, Secretary State Board of Health, Ral-
    eigh, N. C.:
    Dear Doctor Rankin–The following Incident may be of 
use to you in connection with your campaign for permanent
health officers. A gentleman from New York, representing
heavy money interests, called upon me this morning in ref-
erence to buying land in the South for farm purposes. He
stated that he would not touch less than 5,000 acres, and if
he found what he wanted, his purchase would involve some-
where between 5,000 and 50,000 acres. He had obtained ex-
tensive information regarding the soils, crops, etc., but said
he was unable to obtain satisfactory information regarding
health conditions.
    I have advised him to inquire into the subject of the
county health officer in every county where he looks for
land, and have further advised him that I would not be
personally willing to purchase large land holdings of this
extent unless I could obtain from the county authorities a
definite promise that a county health officer should be em-
ployed at a salary of not less than $2,500 per year, and that
he should give his entire time to the work. 
    Respectfully,       (Signed)    C. W. STILES, 
                                Professor of Zoology.

            DR. WILEY ON COFFEE AND TEA. 
    "Many parents forbid the use of tea and coffee to their
children, and 1 think this is a wise precaution. * * * I
think caffein is recognized as one of the habit-forming
drugs." Here is another very good reason why the use of
coffee should be universally discountenanced. A drug which
forms a habit is poison. No one ever becomes so dependent
upon bread or potatoes or any other normal food that
he can not find a substitute in some other wholesome food
which furnishes the same elements. But this is not true of
coffee, or of other habit-forming drugs. The drug itself pro-
duces an effect upon the body which changes it so that it is
no longer normal. The tissues have become perverted; the
body functions have become disturbed in such a way that
the withdrawal of the accustomed drug produces most dis-
tressing symptoms."

                    DIETETICS. 
                A Fools Soliloquy.
    Age 25. "Dietetics"! What is or are dietetics? Who
cares a dime for dietetics? Time enough to attend to that
cranky old matter when one gets sick or old. You don't
get me to listen to the cranks who tell im what to eat and
how to eat it. I never think anything about the matter. I
just eat everything and anything. I like to begin a meal
with a cocktail. It makes appetite, fills me with a glow
and gives enjoyment to the feed. I like rich sauces, gravies,
highly spiced things, lots of rare meats. Salads! Well, I
say yes. Give me lots of salad. Make a dressing with lots
of red pepper and strong vinegar. Do I drink coffee?
Watch me. The stronger and blacker the better. It doesn't
hurt me. It don't keep me awake. I never have a pain.
No dyspepsia in me. Yes, I'm getting a little heavy, but I
feel all right. I'm English, I love to eat."
