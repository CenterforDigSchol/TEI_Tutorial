TYPHOID EPIDEMIC AT VEEDERSBURG. 
WILL SHIMER, M.D.
At the request of Mr. J.L.O., of Veedersburg, we inves-
tigated the cause for the continued presence of typhoid
fever in his family.
August 13, 1911, his oldest daughter, Miss L. M. O., at-
tended an old settlers' picnic, after which she visited a
family in the country for two weeks. September 20th she 
left home to attend college. At that time she bad some 
fever and headache. She returned home in a few days 



and remained in bed until about November 1st with a
typical attack of typhoid fever. Her mother, Mrs. O., took 
care of her. A sister-in-law did the housework and cook-
ing. During October a sister and brother, both under nine
years of age, had attacks of diarrhea and indigestion, from 
which they recovered in less than two weeks. 
During the first week of December, Mrs. O. was com-
pelled to go to bed. She was in bed three weeks with a
typical attack of typhoid. A trained nurse took care of her.
During the second week of January, 1912, a daughter aged
fifteen, went to bed with a typical attack of typhoid and 
had not been able to be up when I visited the O. home, 
February 13th. 
There are several interesting things about this series of 
cases. First, there were no flies during most of the period
covered by these cases; second, there are no causes of 
typhoid among several other people who use milk from the 
same source as this family; and third, they get their water 
from a source which supplies all of Veedersburg, and there 
was possibly only one other case of typhoid in the town. 
Of the various other possible explanations of the source 
of these cases of typhoid in the same family, the one that 
seems most possible to us is that Miss L.M.O. acquired 
her infection somewhere outside the home, that she passed 
the infection on to her younger sister and brother, and she, 
or they, infected their mother, with all of these cases as a
possible source of infection of the last case. 
Mrs. O. described to us the means she took for render-
ing the urine and feces sterile. However, she did not seem 
to appreciate the infectiousness of the stools and urine, for 
she had been told that typhoid fever was neither contagious 
nor infectious, and that she could nurse her daughter with- 
out danger of infecting herself or family. That all of these 
cases except the first one came from close contact is sub-
stantiated by the fact that Mr. O. and a son, sixteen years
of age, did not have typhoid or any intestinal disturbance 
during this period.
