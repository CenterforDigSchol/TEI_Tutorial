### INTRODUCTION TO THE TEXT ENCODING INITIATIVE (TEI) FOR HISTORICAL DOCUMENTS

------



**Description**: 

The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines are a standard defining an XML vocabulary for representing textual materials in digital form. This course will focus on encoding historical primary sources both to give provide context and to support analysis and visualization of features of text relevant to humanities scholars. In this introductory course, participants will focus on documenting provenance of historical materials, recording bibliographic metadata, and developing encoding workflows that identify features of interest. Participants will also become familiar with the TEI guidelines and will discuss how to manage text encoding projects in ways that support uniform data creation and best practices for integrating TEI with other metadata standards.

Participants will review examples of TEI usage in other digital humanities project and then devote time to encoding TEI documents relevant to their research interests. For those with no previous experience, readings about XML and the TEI will be provided prior to class.
