            <fw type="header" rend="centre"> CHAPTER THREE</fw>
            <p>It is, indeed, highly unfortunate, and much to be re-<lb break="no"/>gretted that at this stage
               of <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs>’s career, when <lb/>he played a most important part in the public life of
               his <lb/>country, we have least information to go upon. We <lb/>know that he
               discharged his duties to admiration— wit-<lb break="no"/>ness his Bath and his Dukedom. We know
               that <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> had a <lb/>finger in some of the most delicate negotiations between <lb/>King
               Charles and the Turks— to that, treaties in the <lb/>vault of the Record Office bear
               testimony. But the revo-<lb break="no"/>lution which broke out during his period of office, and
               <lb/>the fire which followed, have so damaged or destroyed <lb/>all those papers from
               which any trustworthy record <lb/>could be drawn, that what we can give is lamentably
               in-<lb break="no"/>complete. Often the paper was scorched a deep brown <lb/>in the middle of
               the most important sentence. Just when <lb/>we thought to elucidate a secret that has
               puzzled his-<lb break="no"/>torians for a hundred years, there was a hole in the man-
               <lb/>uscript big enough to put your finger through. We have <lb/>done our best to
               piece out a meagre summary from the <lb/>charred fragments that remain; but often it
               has been <lb/>necessary to speculate, to surmise, and even to <app n="1"><lem>make use of the</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">use the</rdg></app>
               imagination.</p>

            <p><rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs>’s day was passed, it would seem, somewhat <lb/>in this fashion. About seven,
               <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> would rise, wrap him-<lb break="no"/>self in a long Turkish cloak, light a cheroot, and lean
               his <lb/>elbows on the parapet. Thus <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> would stand, gazing at <lb/>the city beneath
               him, apparently entranced. At this hour <lb/>the mist would lie so thick that the
               domes of <rs type="place">Santa Sofia</rs> <lb/>and the rest would seem to be afloat; gradually the mist
               <lb/>would uncover them; the bubbles would be seen to be <lb/>firmly fixed; there
            would be the river; there the <rs type="place">Galata <lb/>Bridge</rs>; there the <app n="2"><lem>green turbanned</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">green-turbaned</rdg></app> pilgrims
               without eyes <lb/>or noses, begging alms; there the pariah dogs picking up
               <lb/>offal; there the shawled women; there the innumerable <lb/>donkeys; there men on
               horses carrying long poles. Soon, <lb/>the whole town would be astir with the
               cracking of <lb/>whips, the beating of gongs, cryings to prayer, lashing <lb/>of
               mules, and rattle of brass-bound wheels, while sour <lb/>odours, made from bread
               fermenting and incense, and <lb/>spice, rose even to the heights of <rs type="place"
                  notAfter-custom="early 20th century" ref="Beyoğlu">Pera</rs> itself and
               seemed <lb/>the very breath of the strident<app n="3"><lem> and</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1"> </rdg></app> multicoloured and <lb/>barbaric
               population.</p>

            <p>Nothing, <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> reflected, gazing at the view which was <lb/>now sparkling in the sun,
               could well be less like the <lb/>counties of <rs type="place"><district type="county">Surrey</district></rs> and <rs type="place"><district type="county">Kent</district></rs> or the towns of <rs type="place"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></rs>
               and <lb/><rs type="place"><settlement>Tunbridge Wells</settlement></rs>. To the right and left rose in bald and <lb/>stony

               elm, violet, ivy, or wild eglantine. <lb/>There were no hedges for ferns to grow on,
               and no <lb/>fields for sheep to graze. The houses were <app n="4"><lem>bare and bald <lb/>as
               egg-shells</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">white as egg-shells and as bald.</rdg></app>. That he, who was English root and fibre, <lb/>should yet exult to the
               depths of his heart in this wild <lb/>panorama, and gaze and gaze at those passes and
               far heights<lb/><app n="5"><lem>, </lem> <rdg wit="#US1"> </rdg></app>planning journeys there alone on foot where <lb/>only the goat and
               shepherd had gone before; should feel <lb/>a passion of affection for the bright,
               unseasonable flow-<lb break="no"/>ers, love the unkempt, pariah dogs beyond even his elk
               <lb/>hounds at home, and snuff the acrid, sharp smell of the <lb/>streets eagerly
               into his nostrils, surprised him. <rs type="person" key="OrM">He</rs> won-<lb break="no"/>dered if, in the season of the
               Crusades, one of his ances-<lb break="no"/>tors had taken up with a Circassian peasant woman;
               <lb/>thought it possible; fancied a certain darkness in his <lb/>complexion; and,
               going indoors again, withdrew to his <lb/>bath. </p>
            <p>An hour later, properly scented, curled, and anointed<app n="6"><lem> </lem> <rdg wit="UK1">, </rdg></app><lb/><rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> would receive visits
               from secretaries and other high <lb/>officials carrying, one after another, red boxes
               which <lb/>yielded only to his own golden key. Within were papers <lb/>of the
               highest importance, of which only fragments, here <lb/>a flourish, there a seal
               firmly attached to a piece of burnt <lb/>silk, now remain. Of their contents then, we
               cannot <lb/>speak, but can only testify that <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> was kept busy, <lb/><fw
                  type="pageNum" rend="center" n="121">121</fw>

               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
               <lb/>what with his wax and seals, his various coloured rib-<lb break="no"/>bons which had to be
               diversely attached, his engrossing <lb/>of titles and making of flourishes round
               capital letters, <lb/>till luncheon came – a splendid meal of perhaps thirty
               <lb/>courses. </p>
            <p>After luncheon, lackeys announced that his coach and <lb/>six was at the door<app n="7"><lem> </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">, </rdg></app>and he
               went, preceded by purple <lb/><orgName>Janissaries</orgName> running on foot and waving great ostrich
               <lb/>feather fans above their heads, to call upon the other <lb/>ambassadors and
               dignitaries of state. The ceremony was <lb/>always the same. On reaching the
               courtyard, the <orgName>Janis-<lb break="no"/>saries</orgName> struck with their fans upon the main portal, which
               <lb/>immediately flew open revealing a large chamber, splen-<lb break="no"/>didly furnished.
               Here were seated two figures, gener-<lb break="no"/>ally of the opposite sexes. Profound bows
               and curtseys <lb/>were exchanged. In the first room, it was permissible <lb/>only to
               mention the weather. Having said that it was <lb/>fine or wet, hot or cold, the
               <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> then passed on <lb/>to the next chamber, where again, two figures rose to
               <lb/>greet him. Here it was only permissible to compare <rs type="place"><settlement type="city">Con-<lb break="no"/>stantinople</settlement></rs> as a
               place of residence with <rs type="place"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></rs>; and the <lb/><rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> naturally said that he
               preferred <rs type="place"><settlement type="city">Constanti-<lb break="no"/>nople</settlement></rs>, and his hosts naturally said, though they had not
               <lb/>seen it, that they preferred <rs type="place"><settlement type="city">London</settlement></rs>. In the next cham-<lb break="no"/>ber, <rs type="person" key="KCII">King Charles</rs>’s
               and <rs type="person">the Sultan</rs>’s healths had to be <lb/>discussed at some length. In the next were
               discussed the <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="122">122</fw>
               
               <pb n="123"/>
               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
               <lb/><rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs>’s health and that of <rs type="person">his host’s wife</rs>, but more <lb/>briefly. In the
               next the <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> complimented his <lb/>host upon his furniture, and the host
               complimented the <lb/><rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> upon his dress. In the next, sweet meats <lb/>were
               offered, the host deploring their badness, the <rs type="person" key="OrM">Am-<lb break="no"/>bassador</rs> extolling their
               goodness. The ceremony ended <lb/>at length with the smoking of a hookah and the
               drink-<lb break="no"/>ing of a glass of coffee; but though the motions of smok-<lb break="no"/>ing and
               drinking were gone through punctiliously there <lb/>was neither tobacco in the pipe
               nor coffee in the glass, <lb/>as, had either smoke or drink been real, the human
               frame <lb/>would have sunk beneath the surfeit. For, no sooner had <lb/>the
               <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> despatched one such visit, than another <lb/>had to be undertaken. The
               same ceremonies were gone <lb/>through in precisely the same order six or seven times
               <lb/>over at the houses of the other great officials, so that it <lb/>was often late
               at night before the <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> reached <lb/>home. Though <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> performed these
               tasks to admi-<lb break="no"/>ration and never denied that they are, perhaps, the most
               <lb/>important part of a diplomatist’s duties, <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> was undoubt-<lb break="no"/>edly fatigued by
               them, and often depressed to such a <lb/>pitch of gloom that <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> preferred to take his
               dinner alone <lb/>with his dogs. To them, indeed<app n="8"><lem> </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">, </rdg></app><rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> might be heard talk-<lb break="no"/>ing in
               his own tongue. And sometimes, it is said, <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> <lb/>would pass out of his own gates
               late at night so disguised <lb/>that the sentries did not know him. Then <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> would
                  <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="123">123</fw>

               <lb/>mingle with the crowd on the <rs type="place">Galata Bridge</rs>; or stroll <lb/>through the bazaars;
               or throw aside his shoes and join <lb/>the worshippers in the Mosques. Once, when it
               was given <lb/>out that <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> was ill of a fever, shepherds, bringing their <lb/>goats
               to market, reported that they had met an English <lb/>Lord on the mountain top and
               heard him praying to his <lb/>God. This was thought to be <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> himself, and his
                  <lb/>prayer was, no doubt, a poem said aloud, for it was <lb/>known that <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> still
               carried about with him, in the bosom <lb/>of his cloak, a <app n="9"><lem>much-scored</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">much scored</rdg></app> manuscript; and
               servants, <lb/>listening at the door, heard the <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> chanting <lb/>something in
                  an odd, sing-song voice when <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> was alone. </p>
            <p>
               <lb/>It is with fragments such as these that we must do <lb/>our best to make up a
               picture of <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs>’s life and char-<lb break="no"/>acter at this time. There exist, even to
               this day, rumours, <lb/>legends, anecdotes of a floating and unauthenticated
               <lb/>kind about <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs>’s life in <rs type="place"> <settlement type="city">Constantinople</settlement></rs> (we have <lb/>quoted but a few of

               <lb/>green long after all that more durable qualities can do to <lb/>preserve it is

               became the <lb/>adored of many women and some men. It was not neces-<lb break="no"/>sary that
               they should speak to him or even that they <lb/>should see him; they conjured<app n="11"><lem> him </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1"> </rdg></app>up
               before them espe-<lb break="no"/>cially when the scenery was romantic, or the sun was
               <lb/>setting, the figure of a noble gentleman in silk stockings. <lb/>Upon the poor
               and uneducated, <rs type="person" key="OrM">he</rs> had the same power <lb/>as upon the rich. Shepherds, gipsies,

               <lb/>romantic power, it is well known, is often associated with <lb/>a nature of

               <lb/>had seen him once only, and was then busily engaged in <lb/>pelting her royal
               master with nutshells, it is likely that <lb/>it was his merits that won him his

            <p>
               <lb/>Here we must pause, for we have reached a moment <lb/>of great significance in
               his career. For the conferring of <lb/>the Dukedom was the occasion of a very famous,

               our way among burnt papers and little <lb/>bits of tape as best we may. It was at the
               end of the great <lb/>fast of Ramadan that the <orgName>Order of the Bath</orgName> and the <lb/>patent
               of nobility arrived in a frigate commanded by <rs type="person" key="SAS">Sir <lb/>Adrian Scrope</rs>; and <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs>
               made this the occasion for <lb/>an entertainment more splendid than any that has been
               <lb/>known before or since in <rs type="place"><settlement type="city">Constantinople</settlement></rs>. The night was <lb/>fine; the crowd
               immense, and the windows of the Em-<lb break="no"/>bassy brilliantly illuminated. Again,
               details are lacking, <lb/>for the fire had its way with all such records, and has
               left <lb/>only tantalising fragments which leave the most impor-<lb break="no"/>tant points
               obscure. From the diary of <rs type="person" key="JFB">John Fenner <lb/>Brigge</rs>, however, an <rs type="person" key="JFB">English naval</rs>

               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
               <lb/>bowing deeply, and speaking a few words of thanks in <lb/>the Turkish language,
               which it was one of his accom-<lb break="no"/>plishments to speak with fluency. Next, <rs type="person" key="SAS">Sir
                  Adrian <lb/>Scrope</rs>, in the full dress of a British Admiral<app n="18"><lem> </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">, </rdg></app>advanced; <lb/>the

               which <lb/>another gentleman of the diplomatic corps advancing <lb/>in a stately

            <p>At length, with a gesture of extraordinary majesty <lb/>and grace, first bowing
               profoundly, then raising himself <lb/>proudly erect, <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> took the golden circlet
               of straw-<lb break="no"/>berry leaves and placed it, with a gesture which none <lb/>that saw it

               began. Either the people <lb/>had expected a miracle – some say a shower of gold was
               <lb/>prophesied to fall from the skies – which did not hap-<lb break="no"/>pen, or this was the

               settled on <rs type="person" key="OrM">Or-<lb break="no"/>lando</rs>’s brows a great uproar rose. Bells began ringing; <lb/>the
               harsh cries of the prophets were heard above the <lb/>shouts of the people; many
               <orgName>Turks</orgName> fell flat to the ground <lb/>and touched the earth with their foreheads. A door

               <lb/>Women shrieked. A certain lady, who was said to be <lb/>dying for love of

               of <orgName>British bluejackets</orgName>, nobody can say. But <rs type="person" key="SAS">the <lb/>Admiral</rs> ordered the bugles to be
               sounded; a hundred <lb/><orgName>bluejackets</orgName> stood instantly at attention; the disorder was
               <lb/>quelled, and quiet, at least for the time being, fell upon <lb/>the scene. </p>
            <p>So far, we are on the firm, if rather narrow, ground <lb/>of ascertained truth. But
               nobody has ever known exactly <lb/>what took place later that night. The testimony of

               <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs> was seen <lb/>to go to his room, still wearing the insignia of his rank,
               <lb/>and shut the door. Some say he locked it, which was <lb/>against his custom.
               Others maintain that they heard <lb/>music of a rustic kind, such as shepherds play,
               later that <lb/>night in the courtyard under the <rs type="person" key="OrM">Ambassador</rs>’s window. <lb/><rs type="person">A

               <lb/>washer-woman said, they embraced passionately ‘like <lb/>lovers,’ and went into

            <p>Next morning, <rs type="person" key="OrM">the Duke</rs>, as we must now call him, <lb/>was found by his secretaries
               sunk in profound slumber <lb/>amid bed clothes that were much tumbled. The room
               <lb/>was in some disorder, his coronet having rolled on the <lb/>floor, and his cloak
               and garter being flung all of a heap <lb/>on a chair. The table was littered with
               papers. No sus-<lb break="no"/>picion was felt at first, as the fatigues of the night had
               <lb/>been great. But when afternoon came and he still slept, <lb/>a doctor was
               summoned. He applied<app n="21"><lem> the </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1"> </rdg></app>remedies which <lb/>had been used on the previous occasion,
               plasters, nettles, <lb/>emetics, etc., but without success. <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> slept on. His
               <lb/>secretaries then thought it their duty to examine the <lb/>papers on the table.
               Many were scribbled over with <lb/>poetry, in which frequent mention was made of an

               could do to waken him they <lb/>did. But still he slept. </p>
            <p>On the seventh day of his trance (<date>Thursday, May the <lb/>10th</date>) the first shot was
               fired of that terrible and bloody <lb/>insurrection of which <rs type="person" key="JFB">Lieutenant Brigge</rs> had
               detected <lb/>the first symptoms. <orgName>The Turks</orgName> rose against <rs type="person">the Sultan</rs>, <lb/>set fire to
               the town, and put every foreigner they could <lb/>find, either to the sword or to the
               bastinado. A few Eng-<lb break="no"/>lish managed to escape; but, as might have been ex-
               <lb/>pected, the <orgName>gentlemen of the British Embassy</orgName> preferred <lb/>to die in defence of
               their red boxes, or, in extreme cases, <lb/>to swallow bunches of keys rather than
               let them fall into <lb/>the hands of <orgName>the Infidel</orgName>.The rioters broke into <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs>’s

            <p>With gestures of grief and lamentation the three sisters <lb/>now join hands and

            <p> Here they make as if to cover <rs type="person" key="OrM">Orlando</rs> with their <lb/>draperies. The trumpets,

            <fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
            <p>The sound of the trumpets died away and <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> <lb/>stood stark naked. No human
               being, since the world <lb/>began, has ever looked more ravishing. His form com-<lb break="no"/>bined in one the strength of a man and a woman’s grace. <lb/>As he stood there,
               the silver trumpets prolonged their <lb/>note, as if reluctant to leave the lovely
               sight which their <lb/>blast had called forth; and Chastity, Purity, and Mod-
               <lb/>esty, inspired, no doubt, by Curiosity, peeped in at the <lb/>door and threw a
               garment like a towel at the naked form <lb/>which, unfortunately, fell short by
               several inches. <rs type="person" key="OrW">Or-<lb break="no"/>lando</rs> looked himself up and down in a long looking-<lb break="no" rend="keep-hyphen"/>glass, without showing any signs of discomposure, and <lb/>went, presumably, to
               his bath. </p>
            <p>We may take advantage of this pause in the narrative <lb/>to make certain statements.
               <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> had become a wom-<lb break="no"/>an – there is no denying it. But in every other
               respect, <lb/><rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> remained precisely as he had been. The change <lb/>of sex,
               though it altered their future, did nothing what-<lb break="no"/>ever to alter their identity.
               Their faces remained, as their <lb/>portraits prove, practically the same. His
               memory – but <lb/>in future we must, for convention’s sake, say ’her’ for <lb/>‘his,’
               and ‘she’ for ‘he’ – her memory then, went back <lb/>through all the events of her
               past life without encounter-<lb break="no"/>ing any obstacle. Some slight haziness there may
               have <lb/>been, as if a few dark drops had fallen into the clear pool <lb/>of memory;
               certain things had become a little dimmed; <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center"
                  n="138">138</fw>
               <pb n="139"/>
               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
               <lb/>but that was all. The change seemed to have been accom-<lb break="no"/>plished painlessly
               and completely and in such a way that <lb/><rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> herself showed no surprise at it.
               Many people, <lb/>taking this into account, and holding that such a change <lb/>of
               sex is against nature, have been at great pains to prove <lb/>(1) that <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> had
               always been a woman, (2) that <lb/><rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> is at this moment a man. Let <orgName>biologists</orgName>
               and <lb/><orgName>psychologists</orgName> determine. It is enough for us to state the <lb/>simple fact;
               <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> was a man till the age of thirty; <lb/>when he became a woman and has
               remained so ever since. </p>
            <p>But let other pens treat of sex and sexuality; we quit <lb/>such odious subjects as
               soon as we can. <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> had now <lb/>washed, and dressed herself in those Turkish
               coats and <lb/>trousers which can be worn indifferently by either sex; <lb/>and was
               forced to consider her position. That it was pre-<lb break="no"/>carious and embarrassing in
               the extreme must be the first <lb/>thought of every reader who has followed her story
               with <lb/>sympathy. Young, noble, beautiful, she had woken to <lb/>find herself in a
               position than which we can conceive <lb/>none more delicate for <rs type="person" key="OrW">a young lady of rank</rs>.
               We should <lb/>not have blamed her had she rung the bell, screamed, or <lb/>fainted.
               But <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> showed no such signs of pertur-<lb break="no"/>bation. All her actions were
               deliberate in the extreme, <lb/>and might indeed have been thought to show tokens of
               <lb/>premeditation. First, she carefully examined the papers <lb/>on the table; took
               such as seemed to be written in poetry, <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="139"

               <lb/><fw type="header" rend="center">ORLANDO</fw>
               <lb/>and secreted them in her bosom; next she called her Se-<lb break="no"/>leuchi hound, which
               had never left her bed all these days, <lb/>though half famished with hunger, fed and
               combed <lb/>him; then stuck a pair of pistols in her belt; finally wound <lb/>about
               her person several strings of emeralds and pearls <lb/>of the finest orient which had
               formed part of her Ambas-<lb break="no"/>sadorial wardrobe. This done, she leant out of the
               win-<lb break="no"/>dow, gave one low whistle, and descended the shattered <lb/>and
               bloodstained staircase, now strewn with the litter of <lb/><app n="28"><lem>waste paper</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">waste-paper</rdg></app> baskets,
               treaties, despatches, seals, sealing <lb/>wax, etc., and so entered the courtyard.
               There, in the <lb/>shadow of a giant fig tree waited <rs type="person" key="RES">an old <lb/><app n="29"><lem>Gipsy</lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">gipsy</rdg></app></rs> on a don-<lb break="no"/>key.
               He led another by the bridle. <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> swung her <lb/>leg over it; and thus, attended
               by a lean dog, riding a <lb/>donkey, in company of a gipsy, <rs type="person" key="OrW">the Ambassador of

               acquitted <lb/>herself with courage. Within a week they reached the <lb/>high ground

               <lb/>always, to a reflective mind, gives food for thought. For <lb/>some time,
               however, she was too well pleased with the <lb/>change to spoil it by thinking. The

               down, on they moved again. She <lb/>washed in streams if she washed at all; no boxes,
               red, <lb/>blue, or green<app n="33"><lem> </lem> <rdg wit="#UK1">, </rdg></app>were presented to her; there was not a key, <lb/>let alone a

               too often described to need describing <lb/>afresh, save very briefly. There were
               mountains; there were <lb/>valleys; there were streams. She climbed the mountains;
               <lb/>roamed the valleys; sat on the banks of the streams. She <lb/>likened the hills

               <lb/>hyacinth, the purple iris wrought her to cry out in ecstasy <lb/>at the
               goodness, the beauty of nature; raising her eyes <lb/>again, she beheld the eagle
               soaring, and imagined its <lb/>raptures and made them her own. Returning home, she
               <lb/>saluted each star, each peak, and each watch-fire as if <lb/>they signalled to
               her alone; and at last, when she flung <lb/>herself upon her mat in the gipsies’
               tent, she could not <lb/>help bursting out again, How good to eat! How good to
               <lb/>eat! (For it is a curious fact that though human beings <lb/>have such imperfect
               means of communication, that they <lb/>can only say ‘good to eat’ when they mean
               ‘beautiful’ and <lb/>the other way about, they will yet endure ridicule and
               <lb/>misunderstanding rather than keep any experience to <lb/>themselves.) All the

               out <lb/>of <rs type="place"><settlement type="city">Constantinople</settlement></rs> on his donkey, sat silent. He had a <lb/>nose like a

               he was brown and <lb/>keen-eyed, and as he sat tugging at his hookah he ob-
               <lb/>served <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> narrowly. He had the deepest suspicion <lb/>that her God was
               Nature. One day, he found her in <lb/>tears. Interpreting this to mean that her God
               had pun-<lb break="no"/>ished her, he told her that he was not surprised. He <lb/>showed her
               the fingers of his left hand, withered by the <lb/>frost; he showed her his right
               foot, crushed where a rock <lb/>had fallen. This, he said, was what her God did to
               men. <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="144">144</fw>

               <lb/>When she said, <q type="spoken"> “But so beautiful,”</q> using the English <lb/>word, he shook his
               head; and when she repeated it he <lb/>was angry. He saw that she did not believe
               what he be-<lb break="no"/>lieved, and that was enough, wise and ancient as he was, <lb/>to
               enrage him.</p>
            <p>This difference of opinion disturbed <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs>, who <lb/>had been perfectly happy until
               now. She began to think, <lb/>was Nature beautiful or cruel; and then she asked
               herself <lb/>what this beauty was; whether it was in things them-<lb break="no"/>selves, or
               only in herself; so she went on to the nature of <lb/>reality, which led her to
               truth, which in its turn, led to <lb/>Love, Friendship, Poetry (as in the days on the
               high <lb/>mound at home) which meditations, since she could im-<lb break="no"/>part no word of
               them, made her long, as she had never <lb/>longed before, for pen and ink. </p>
            <p><q type="spoken">“Oh! if only I could write !”</q> she cried (for she had the <lb/>odd conceit of those
               who write that words written are <lb/>shared). She had no ink; and but little paper.
               But she <lb/>made ink from berries and wine; and finding a few <lb/>margins and blank
               spaces in the manuscript of “The Oak <lb/>Tree,” managed, by writing a kind of

               enough. This kept her extremely happy <lb/>for hours on end. But <orgName>the gipsies</orgName> became
               suspicious. <lb/>First, they noticed that she was less adept than before at <lb/><fw

               <lb/>milking and cheese-making; next, she often hesitated <lb/>before replying; and
               once a gipsy boy who had been <lb/>asleep, woke in a terror feeling her eyes upon
               him. Some-<lb break="no"/>times this constraint would be felt by the whole tribe, <lb/>numbering
               some dozens of grown men and women. It <lb/>sprang from the sense they had (and their
               senses are very <lb/>sharp and much in advance of their vocabulary) that
               <lb/>whatever they were doing crumbled like ashes in their <lb/>hands. An old woman
               making a basket, a boy skinning <lb/>a sheep, would be singing or crooning
               contentedly at <lb/>their work, when <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> would come into the camp, <lb/>fling
               herself down by the fire and gaze into the flames. <lb/>She need not even look at
               them, and yet they felt, here <lb/>is someone who doubts; (we make a rough-and-ready
               <lb/>translation from the gipsy language) here is someone <lb/>who does not do the
               thing for the sake of doing; nor <lb/>looks for looking’s sake; here is someone who
               believes <lb/>neither in sheep-skin nor basket; but sees (here they <lb/>looked
               apprehensively about the tent) something else. <lb/>Then a vague but most unpleasant
               feeling would begin to <lb/>work in the boy and in the old woman. They broke their
               <lb/>withys; they cut their fingers. A great rage filled them. <lb/>They wished
               <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs> would leave the tent and never <lb/>come near them again. Yet she was of a
               cheerful and <lb/>willing disposition, they owned; and one of her pearls <lb/>was
               enough to buy the finest herd of goats in <rs type="place">Broussa</rs>.</p>

            <p>Slowly, she began to feel that there was some differ-<lb break="no"/>ence between her and <orgName>the
               gipsies</orgName> which made her hesi-<lb break="no"/>tate sometimes to marry and settle down among them
               <lb/>for ever. At first she tried to account for it by saying that <lb/>she came of
               an ancient and civilised race, whereas these <lb/>gipsies were an ignorant people,
               not much better than <lb/>savages. One night when they were questioning her
               <lb/>about <rs type="place"><country>England</country></rs> she could not help with some pride de-<lb break="no"/>scribing the house
               where she was born, how it had 365 <lb/>bedrooms and had been in the possession of
               her family <lb/>for four or five hundred years. Her ancestors were earls, <lb/>or
               even dukes, she added. At this she noticed again that <lb/>the gipsies were uneasy;
               but not angry as before when <lb/>she had praised the beauty of nature. Now they were
               <lb/>courteous, but concerned as people of fine breeding are <lb/>when a stranger has
               been made to reveal his low birth or <lb/>poverty. <rs type="person" key="RES">Rustum</rs> followed her out of the
               tent alone and <lb/>said that she need not mind if her father were a Duke, <lb/>and
               possessed all the bedrooms and furniture that she <lb/>described. They would none of
               them think the worse of <lb/>her for that. Then she was seized with a shame that she
               <lb/>had never felt before. It was clear that <rs type="person" key="RES">Rustum</rs> and the <lb/>other gipsies
               thought a descent of four or five hundred <lb/>years only the meanest possible. Their
               own families went <lb/>back at least two or three thousand years. To the gipsy

               More-<lb break="no"/>over, where the shepherd boy had a lineage of such an-<lb break="no"/>tiquity, there
               was nothing specially memorable or de-<lb break="no"/>sirable in ancient birth; vagabonds and
               beggars all shared <lb/>it. And then, though he was too courteous to speak
               <lb/>openly, it was clear that <rs type="person" key="RES">the gipsy</rs> thought that there was <lb/>no more vulgar
               ambition than to possess bedrooms by <lb/>the hundred (they were on top of a hill as
               they spoke; it <lb/>was night; the mountains rose around them) when the <lb/>whole
               earth is ours. Looked at from the gipsy point of <lb/>view, a Duke, <rs type="person" key="OrW">Orlando</rs>
               understood, was nothing but a <lb/>profiteer or robber who snatched land and money
               from <lb/>people who rated these things of little worth, and could <lb/>think of
               nothing better to do than to build three hun-<lb break="no"/>dred and sixty-five bedrooms when
               one was enough, and <lb/>none was even better than one. She could not deny <lb/>that
               her ancestors had accumulated field after field; <lb/>house after house; honour after
               honour; yet had none <lb/>of them been saints or heroes, or great benefactors of
               <lb/>the human race. Nor could she counter the argument <lb/>(<rs type="person" key="RES">Rustum</rs> was too much of
               a gentleman to press it, but <lb/>she understood) that any man who did now what her
               an-<lb break="no"/>cestors had done three or four hundred years ago would <lb/>be

            </p>
            <p>She sought to answer such arguments by the familiar <lb/>if oblique method of finding
               the Gipsy life itself rude <lb/>and barbarous; and so, in a short time, much bad

               Within, she could <lb/>see an undulating and grassy lawn; she could see oak

               branches. She could see the deer <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="150"

               <lb/>stepping delicately from shade to shade, and could even <lb/>hear the hum of
               insects and the gentle sighs and shivers <lb/>of a summer’s day in <rs type="place"><country>England</country></rs>. After she
               had gazed en <lb/>tranced for some time, snow began falling; soon the <lb/>whole
               landscape was covered and marked with violet <lb/>shades instead of yellow sunlight.
               Now she saw heavy <lb/>carts coming along the roads, laden with tree trunks,
               <lb/>which they were taking, she knew, to be sawn for fire-<lb break="no"/>wood; and then there
               appeared the roofs and belfries and <lb/>towers and courtyards of her own home. The
               snow was <lb/>falling steadily, and she could now hear the slither and <lb/>flop
               which it made as it slid down the roof and fell to the <lb/>ground. The smoke went up
               from a thousand chimneys. <lb/>All was so clear and minute that she could see a daw
               <lb/>pecking for worms in the snow. Then, gradually, the <lb/>violet shadows deepened
               and closed over the carts and <lb/>the lawns and the great house itself. All was
               swallowed <lb/>up. Now there was nothing left of the grassy hollow, <lb/>and instead
               of the green lawns was only the blazing hill-<lb break="no" rend="keep hyphen"/>side which a thousand vultures
               seemed to have picked <lb/>bare. At this, she burst into a passion of tears, and
               strid-<lb break="no"/>ing back to the gipsies’ camp, told them that she must <lb/>sail for
               <rs type="place"><country>England</country></rs> the very next day.</p>
            <p>It was happy for her that she did so. Already the young <lb/>men had plotted her
               death. Honour, they said, de-<lb break="no"/>manded it, for she did not think as they did. Yet
               they <lb/><fw type="pageNum" rend="center" n="151">151</fw>

               <lb/>would have been sorry to cut her throat; and welcomed <lb/>the news of her
               departure. An English merchant ship, <lb/>as luck would have it, was already under

               <lb/>ing of another pearl from her necklace not only paid her <lb/>passage but had
               some banknotes left over in her wallet. <lb/>These she would have liked to present to
               <orgName>the gipsies</orgName>. But <lb/>they despised wealth she knew; and she had to content
               <lb/>herself with embraces, which on her part were sincere. <lb/><fw type="pageNum"
