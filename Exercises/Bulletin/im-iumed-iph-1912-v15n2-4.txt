MONTHLY BULLETIN, INDIANA State BOARd O F health Mr. O. ami his son aire now being: vaccinated against
typhoid. The conclusions to he drawn from these cases are as follows: 1. No person who nurses a case of typhoid fever should have anything to do
with preparing or cooking food for anybody else. 2. The nurse should carefully sterilize her hands before eat ing. 3. The feces and urine must
be sterilized before dis.posal. 4. All bed linen and other things used by typhoid pa.tients must be sterilized before being washed or used by any
one else. 5. All members of the family, as well as the nurse, should be vaccinated against typhoid. 6. In all cases, where possible, the patient
should be isolated from the family, or. even better, taken to a general hospital, if it is possible. The rules are very necessary, for after water,
milk and bacilli carriers, direct contact with persons sick with typhoid fever is the most fruitful source of typhoid infec.tion. CURREN T REFERENCES
